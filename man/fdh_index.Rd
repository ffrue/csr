\title{Find FDH Frontier Points}
\usage{
fdh_index(xtab, ytab)
}
\arguments{
\item{xtab}{numeric vector of x-indices of data points}

\item{ytab}{numeric vector of y-indices of data points}
}
\value{
numeric vector with x-indices of points on the FDH-frontier
}
\description{
finds the x-indices of points on the FDH-frontier (Free Disposal Hull)
}
\details{
The free disposal hull method was developed in Deprins, Simar and Tulkens (1984). It is the lowest stair-case curve on or above all data points and by design monotonically increasing.
Formally, it is defined as \deqn{\phi(x)_n = \max \{ y_i, i:x_i \leq x \} }
The function returns the indices of all data points on the FDH (where \eqn{y_i = \phi(x_i)}).
By linearly connecting these points one arrives at the linearized FDH curve.
