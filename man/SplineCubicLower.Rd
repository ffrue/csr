\description{
fits an (un)constrained cubic spline as lower frontier with predefined number of knots
}
\details{
The lower boundary curve fitted by this function is a cubic spline with selected number of knots \eqn{t_j} (location chosen at quantiles of $x$)
and the solution to the optimization problem \deqn{\min_\alpha \int \pi(x)^T \alpha dx = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \alpha_j \int \pi_j(x) dx}
subject to the envelopment constraint \eqn{\pi(x_i)^T \alpha \leq y_i \forall i=1,...,n}.
Intuitively, the boundary is chosen to maximize the area under the fitted curve while also being weakly below all data points.
If cv >= 0, it is also subject to the monotonicity constraint \eqn{\alpha_1 + 2 \alpha_2 t_{j-1} + 3\alpha_3 t_{j-1}^2 + \sum_{l=1}^{j-1} 3 \alpha_{l+3}(t_{j-1}-t_l)^2}.
If cv = 1, the concavity constraint \eqn{\pi''(t_j)^T \alpha \leq 0 \quad \forall j = 0,1,...,k_n} is also imposed.
The implementation of the cubic spline fitting follows the approach outlined in Daouia, Noh and Park 2016 and uses the
framework from the CVXR package.
